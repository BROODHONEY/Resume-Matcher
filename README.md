# AI-Powered Resume Matcher using BERT

A beginner-friendly project that uses Machine Learning and NLP to match resumes to job descriptions based on **semantic similarity**. Built in a Jupyter Notebook for learning purposes.

---

## Project Overview

This project extracts text from real resumes (PDF/DOCX) stored inside the `resumes/` folder, embeds them using **Sentence-BERT**, and matches them against a job description using **cosine similarity**. The goal is to simulate how modern ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems) work, and to learn about **semantic text similarity**, **text embedding**, and **NLP in ML applications**.
